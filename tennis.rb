# v.2 - incorporates refactoring suggestions and naming conventions suggested by Evegeny, 21 Aug 2013:
# 			changed the score array to a constant in Match class
#				to keep track of the player who won the point, used a reference to one of the player instances
# v.1 - incorporates game and set scoring as well as point scoring
# 2 classes - Player holds play info and scores; Match contains methods to handle the scoring
